	abstract = {We investigate how the stock market values innovations by developing a general equilibrium quality-ladder growth model with technological interdependence across sectors. Our model highlights the importance of sectoral technology centrality, which captures the position of sectors in the technology network. Sectors with greater technology centrality are hubs of the technology network and receive greater knowledge spillovers, making innovations in these sectors more valuable. We empirically examine the relationship between the value of innovations and their centrality by adopting an event study approach to estimate the economic value of patents and using a comprehensive patent citation database to construct the empirical counterpart of technology centrality in our model. Our estimation results suggest that the average patent value in the sector at the 75th percentile of technology centrality is 80% higher than that in the sector at the 25th percentile.},

	abstract = {Mandatory disclosure could increase price informativeness by crowding in the manager’s unknown information into the price. By learning from the price, the manager increases the firm’s investment efficiency. In this study, we use the mandatory disclosure regulation of company visits as an exogenous shock to test the learning channel. We find that there is a positive learning effect in the Chinese market. Consistent with the learning theory, we show that the effect is determined by the information types of disclosure. In addition, a higher disclosure precision will amplify this effect: firms that disclose more precise information exhibit a stronger learning effect. Overall, we add to the existing literature novel empirical evidence on the learning channel of mandatory disclosure and its real effect.},
