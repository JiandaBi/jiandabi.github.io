	abstract = {The theoretical literature highlights the critical role of resource allocation efficiency in driving the economic impact of innovation and industrial policies. However, few empirical studies have examined how basic research investment should be allocated across different disciplines. This study addresses this gap by investigating the effects of basic research investment on economic productivity and resilience. Specifically, we extend the framework of Acemoglu and Azar (2020) to allow for heterogeneous industry-level total factor efficiency change and investigation on labor market shares. Our findings reveal that (i) basic research investment significantly enhances the efficiency of various industries in China; (ii) industries with stronger interconnections get greater economic benefits and exhibit higher employment shares; (iii) counterfactual analysis suggests that basic research investment in high-tech sectors can substantially improve overall productivity and economic resilience; and (iv) improving the efficiency of complementary industries can yield economic outcomes comparable to directly targeting constrained sectors. These results underscore the strategic importance of basic research investment in fostering sustainable economic growth and resilience.},

	abstract = {We investigate how the stock market values innovations by developing a general equilibrium quality-ladder growth model with technological interdependence across sectors. Our model highlights the importance of sectoral technology centrality, which captures the position of sectors in the technology network. Sectors with greater technology centrality are hubs of the technology network and receive greater knowledge spillovers, making innovations in these sectors more valuable. We empirically examine the relationship between the value of innovations and their centrality by adopting an event study approach to estimate the economic value of patents and using a comprehensive patent citation database to construct the empirical counterpart of technology centrality in our model. Our estimation results suggest that the average patent value in the sector at the 75th percentile of technology centrality is 80% higher than that in the sector at the 25th percentile.},

	abstract = {Mandatory disclosure could increase price informativeness by crowding in the manager’s unknown information into the price. By learning from the price, the manager increases the firm’s investment efficiency. In this study, we use the mandatory disclosure regulation of company visits as an exogenous shock to test the learning channel. We find that there is a positive learning effect in the Chinese market. Consistent with the learning theory, we show that the effect is determined by the information types of disclosure. In addition, a higher disclosure precision will amplify this effect: firms that disclose more precise information exhibit a stronger learning effect. Overall, we add to the existing literature novel empirical evidence on the learning channel of mandatory disclosure and its real effect.},

	abstract = {Proponents of participatory democracy praise Liquid Democracy: decisions are taken by referendum, but voters delegate their votes freely. When better informed voters are present, delegation can increase the probability of a correct decision. However, delegation must be used sparely because it reduces the information aggregated through voting. In two different experiments, we find that delegation underperforms both universal majority voting and the simpler option of abstention. In a tightly controlled lab experiment where the subjects' precision of information is conveyed in precise mathematical terms and very salient, the result is due to overdelegation. In a perceptual task run online where the precision of information is not known precisely, delegation remains very high and again underperforms both majority voting and abstention. In addition, subjects substantially overestimate the precision of the better informed voters, underlining that Liquid Democracy is fragile to multiple sources of noise. The paper makes an innovative methodological contribution by combining two very different experimental procedures: the study of voting rules would benefit from complementing controlled experiments with known precision of information with tests under ambiguity, a realistic assumption in many voting situations.},
