  title={The appropriate level of financial inclusion: The perspective of financial stability},
  author={Hua, Xiuping and Bi,* Jianda and Shi, Haoqian},
  abstract={We construct a global financial inclusion index using data from the World Bank, IMF, and V-Lab and propose an inverted U-shaped relationship between financial inclusion and financial stability. The empirical evidence supports our hypotheses, and the impact of financial inclusion on financial stability is less prominent under strong regulation and supervision. In addition, we use our constructed financial inclusion index, capital adequacy ratio, market power, and macroeconomic variables to simulate and predict the financial crisis. Our research has important policy implications and provides valuable insights to financial regulatory authorities in making decisions related to financial inclusion and financial stability.},
